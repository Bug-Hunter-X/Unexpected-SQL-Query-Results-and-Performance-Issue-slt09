This repository demonstrates a common SQL error related to NULL values in comparison operations and potential performance problems with poorly optimized queries. The `bug.sql` file contains the problematic query, while `bugSolution.sql` presents solutions for handling NULL values and optimizing performance.  The primary issue highlights how NULL comparisons can lead to unexpected data exclusion. The secondary issue demonstrates the importance of indexed columns for efficient query execution.
